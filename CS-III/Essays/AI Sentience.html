      <p> Hello, Welcome to my Digital Portfolio. My name is Kingston Armstrong. I dont really have much so far but I plan on putting alot of things in here.

      <h1> AI Sentience</h1>
      <p>
	<!-- I believe that Sentient AI will lead to the downfall of humans. As a people, I believe humans evolved to be the most dominant animal on earth due to our intelligence and our brains. For A computer to be able to think like us means we aren't the most intelligent anymore. A computer is perfect always executing the same way based on what is given, they don't make mistakes. AI only works when it has huge amounts of data to compare to the given. People are very similar our choices are influenced by our lives and our experiences, but we make a lot of mistakes. The main issue is that people aren't perfect and computers are. If the AI ever decided that people were the problem and actively tried to get rid of us would we win? Considering that these Intlegent computers think like us would we be able to use our computer-based systems? Would they use their superior knowledge and robotic memory to control everything?
