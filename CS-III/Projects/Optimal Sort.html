  After looking at the graphs and data listed on the spreadsheet I noticed a couple of things. First I noticed that with huge tables of data bubble sort struggles while the other 2 stay relativly close to eachother. Bubble sort couldnt fully sort the 100000 word list in less than 5 minutes for any of the file types. It would just crash the program before finishing. InsertionSort also couldnt sort the 100000 woord list when the filetype was ordered. My fastest times were always the reverse-orderd, I think this is beacsue the code I used to make the array. I have a loop that will read the input and when it isnt nill it will insert the input at the index 0. So, the extire array is flipped when put it in so it alrealy sorted. I execpect my classmates to have the exact opposite where orderd is alot fater than reverse. Lastly I noticed that with more words the time spent jumped exponentially. Initally I thought since Insetion can do 10000 words in 1.2 seconds it should be able to do 100000 in 12 seconds, but the data proved me wrong. With more words there is more work to go through.
