      <h1> Considered Projects </h1>
      
      <u><h2>aaron-berdecia</h2></u>
      <p>
	I like the game idea but it dosent do into depth about how the game would play out or the type of tower defence game.
      </p>
      <u><h2>nimrod-ohayon-rozanes </h2></u>
      <p>
	Making an electric motor cycle is really cool but motorcyles arent my thing and they dont intrest me.
	
      </p>
      <u><h2>SOLUTION</h2></u>
      <p>
	My solution is to create a game that is a different type of bullet hell.
      </p>
      <u><h2>TARGET MARKET</h2></u>
      <p>
	My targeet audience is the Rougelike bullet hell audience.
      </p>
      <u><h2>COMPETITION</h2></u>
      <p>
	My competition would be other games of the same type. I think we do something different to the point where it will entice people to play.
      </p>
      <u><h2>REVENUE STREAMS</h2></u>
      <p>
	My revenu stream would be of game sells. If not game sells maybe in-app purchaes or adds.
      </p>
      <u><h2>MARKETING STREAMS</h2></u>
      <p>
	I can market this project through differnt gamming communites or paying youtubers or twitch streamers to try out the game. 
      </p>
      <u><h2>EXPENSES</h2></u>
      <p>
	My expences would be my time and development. And If i want to truly sell this to people I need to get a artist to design the art for the game.
      </p>
      <u><h2>TEAM AND KEY ROLES</h2></u>
      <p>
	I dont expect there to be a big team for this so for an team. We would have A Project Lead that would oversee eveything. Then a person that would see the art direction and where that would go.
