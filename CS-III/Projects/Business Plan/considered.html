	I like the game idea but it dosent do into depth about how the game would play out or the type of tower defence game.

	Making an electric motor cycle is really cool but motorcyles arent my thing and they dont intrest me.

	I like the idea of making an app that will track busses but this is nothing new and how will it be different from other apps that already exist.

      <u><h2> Robert-Brugger</h2></u>
      <p>

      <u><h2>REVENUE STREAMS</h2></u>
      <p>
	My revenu stream would be of game sells. If not game sells maybe in-app purchaes or adds.
      </p>
      <u><h2>MARKETING STREAMS</h2></u>
      <p>
	I can market this project through differnt gamming communites or paying youtubers or twitch streamers to try out the game.
      </p>
      <u><h2>EXPENSES</h2></u>
      <p>
	My expences would be my time and development. And If i want to truly sell this to people I need to get a artist to design the art for the game.
      </p>
      <u><h2>TEAM AND KEY ROLES</h2></u>
      <p>
	I dont expect there to be a big team for this so for an team. We would have A Project Lead that would oversee eveything. Then a person that would see the art direction and where that would go.
