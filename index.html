      <p>
	I'm a High school senior. Growing up I have always wanted to make video games. Thats why I started studying Computer Science. Throughout my life I've loved learing about how games were made. Whether it be how life influenced the design of the game or how certain game mechincs were exploited and used to benifit the player in a way the dev didnt expect. I just loved the community games created, and I really want to be apart of that. <br><br>
	I also play Varsity football. I start at guard for the Allen Eagles. I have worked extremely hard for where I am and I dont plan to stop. To The left is a few photos taken of me on the field, I love the sport and I hope I can continue this later in my life. <br><br>
